# Delivery Routing and Box optimization

Vehicle routing is one of the most famous problems in the field of computational algorithms and it has been one of the challenging problems since the stone age. People use this to optimize the path on which they want to travel and reach sooner. Routing has a vital role in modern warfare and other strategic operations. Most commonly used in delivery companies like Amazon, Blue dart, Flipkart, Delhivery, and other MNC brands that deal with logistics and delivery systems. Even Movers can use this concept. My algorithm is a combination of 3 powerful concepts which have been the state of the art computational algorithms for so many years hence even parts of the algorithm can be used for various other activities in real-life applications whether that is technical or non-technical.

- This project focuses on optimizing the route and the delivery box.
- Here we collect data using dbsqlite and convert to csv format for storage.
- Using greedy apporach we maximize the profit based on value/weight ratio.
- Since we cant take fractionally an item we either take it completely or leave it.
